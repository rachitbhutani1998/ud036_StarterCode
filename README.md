# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

The source code of this Movie Trailer Website is written in python. It uses the basic concepts of classes.

The [movieClass](https://github.com/rachitbhutani1998/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/movieClass.py) is used to make different instances for movies. 

Then the list of movies is prepared and passed to the [fresh_tomatoes](https://github.com/rachitbhutani1998/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py) python file which creates a webpage for the movies from the list obtained.
